# iRTcmix-demos
demo Xcode projects for iRTcmix

There are four sub-directories here:

1.  iRTcmix-3.00-basic1
	This is a very bare-bones RTcmix example.  A button plays a single tone.

2.  iRTcmix-3.00-basic2
	A slightly (very slightly) more complex example.  A script schedules
	several random notes, and can be re-triggered by a MAXBANG (if enabled
	by a switch on the interface)

3.  iRTcmix-3.00-basic3
	A very bare-bones example of live audio processing.  A button starts
	a simple PANECHO script.  A 'flush' button is also provided to stop
	the script.

4.  iRTcmix-3.00-demo
	Written by Damon Holzborn, this shows nearlyt all the features of
	iRTcmix-3.00.  Use this as a resource for seeing how to do particular
	things (like play a soundfile or an internal audio buffer, see error
	messages, etc.).

See the README file in the https://github.com/RTcmix/iRTcmix repository for instructions on how to create an Xcode/iRTcmix project.
